# Recent Breakthroughs in Protein Folding

## Executive Summary

The protein folding field has moved decisively beyond the original AlphaFold 2 milestone, entering a phase defined by whole-biomolecular-complex prediction, AI-driven drug binding affinity estimation, and massively scaled open-source inference. 

Structural biology is entering a new phase beyond the original breakthrough of AlphaFold 2, with two emerging frontiers poised to redefine the field: the prediction of full protein conformational landscapes and the routine de novo design of high-affinity protein binders.

 In parallel, commercial translation is accelerating: 

the commercial impact of AlphaFold 3 is most visible through Isomorphic Labs, which has been translating structural predictions into a massive pipeline of new therapeutics, having signed landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novartis worth a combined $3 billion in early 2024.

## Key Findings

- **Nobel Prize recognition (Oct. 2024):** 

The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the developers of AlphaFold, highlighting the societal importance of computational protein structure prediction.

 

David Baker, along with Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry

 for their work in AI-driven protein structure prediction and computational protein design. [1]

- **AlphaFold 3 expands beyond single proteins (May 2024):** 

In May 2024, DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs launched AlphaFold 3 (AF3), a revolutionary AI system capable of predicting the 3D structures and interactions of proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions, and other biomolecules with remarkable precision. Unlike its predecessors, AF3 uses a novel diffusion-based architecture that allows it to model complex molecular systems beyond single proteins, achieving significantly higher accuracy in predicting protein-ligand, protein-nucleic acid, and multi-component complexes.

 [2]

- **AlphaFold's measurable research impact:** 

An independent analysis of AlphaFold 2's impact suggests that researchers using AlphaFold 2 see an increase of over 40% in their submission of novel experimental protein structures. Those protein structures are more likely to be dissimilar to known structures, and research linked to AlphaFold 2 is twice as likely to be cited in clinical articles than typical works in structural biology.

 The AlphaFold Server has 

empowered non-commercial researchers globally, making more than 8 million folds for thousands of researchers around the world.

- **Boltz-2: Unified structure + binding affinity (June 6, 2025):** 

MIT's Jameel Clinic and Recursion released Boltz-2, a first-of-its-kind biomolecular foundation model powered by Recursion's NVIDIA supercomputer, achieving best-in-class accuracy in jointly modeling complex structures and binding affinities — the next step beyond AlphaFold3.

 

Boltz-2 approaches the accuracy of physics-based free energy perturbation (FEP) at speeds up to 1,000× faster

, and 

dropped the cost from approximately $100 per prediction taking 6–12 hours to just a few cents for a 20-second prediction on a single GPU.

 [4]

- **Real-world drug discovery acceleration via Boltz-2:** 

At Recursion, drug discovery programs were completed in 18 months instead of the industry average of 42 months, while the number of compounds requiring synthesis dropped to just a few hundred from an industry average of 5,000–10,000.

 [5]

- **LLNL + El Capitan supercomputer sets protein folding speed record (Nov. 14, 2025):** 

Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and collaborators at AMD and Columbia University completed the largest and fastest protein structure prediction workflow ever run, producing high-quality 3D structure predictions for more than 41 million proteins — at a scale and speed previously thought impossible — using El Capitan, the world's fastest supercomputer, with OpenFold3, an open-source reproduction of AlphaFold3.

 

ElMerFold achieved a 17.2-fold speedup over the original OpenFold2 implementation.

 [6]

- **OpenFold3 challenges AlphaFold3's closed-source dominance (Oct. 2025):** 

Scientists released a 'sneak preview' of a new open-source AI model that predicts 3D structures of proteins, saying it is close to matching the performance of Google DeepMind's revolutionary protein-folding AI. The developers of OpenFold3 hope it will one day perform on par with DeepMind's protein-structure model.

 

The OpenFold models are publicly available and openly licensed, making them an essential tool for democratizing access to cutting-edge protein-structure prediction, while AlphaFold's licensing restrictions limit broader scientific use.

 [7]

- **The next frontier: dynamic conformational landscapes (2025):** 

While deep learning has revolutionized static protein structure prediction, protein function is not solely determined by static 3D structures but is fundamentally governed by dynamic transitions between multiple conformational states. This shift from static to multi-state representations is crucial for understanding the mechanistic basis of protein function and regulation.

 

CASP is pushing for the next prediction frontier — modeling whole conformational landscapes — and CASP15 and 16 created dedicated tracks for ensemble and alternative conformation modeling, motivating new approaches that came out during 2025.

## Analysis

The period from 2024 to mid-2025 marks a pivot from "can we predict a protein's structure?" to "can we predict how all life's molecules interact, and what that interaction is worth to a drug?" AlphaFold 3's diffusion-based architecture and Boltz-2's unified structure-plus-affinity model represent qualitatively different tools from their predecessors — ones aimed squarely at accelerating the pharmaceutical pipeline. 

Major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Novartis, and AstraZeneca, have begun integrating AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold models into their internal drug discovery pipelines to automate structure prediction, molecular docking, and candidate compound screening.

 The industrial adoption is no longer experimental; it is operational.

What remains contested and unresolved is the field's central remaining challenge: static snapshots versus dynamic reality. 

As ML models mastered static structure prediction, a new frontier has come into focus in 2025: capturing protein dynamics and multiple conformational states. Real proteins are flexible molecular machines that may fold into ensembles of shapes critical for function, yet AlphaFold 2 and 3 largely return a single static structure — essentially a snapshot of the most favorable conformation.

 Additionally, 

biosecurity experts have raised alarms about AI-designed synthetic variants of dangerous toxins that remain biologically active but are "invisible" to current biosecurity screening software, leading to calls for a new global framework for digital watermarking of AI-designed biological sequences.

 The next 12–18 months will be defined by progress on ensemble prediction, the maturation of open-source competitors to AlphaFold 3, and the first AI-designed therapeutics reaching human clinical trials.
